Module 20 Challenge: Credit-Risk-Classification

Credit Risk Analysis Report

1. An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to train and evaluate a model using historical data from a peer-to-peer lending services company to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. 

We started by reading the data from the CSV file "lending_data.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame. After, we create the labels set (y) from the "loan_status" column. The values in the "loan_status" column are either 0, which mean that the loan is healthy, and 1, which means that the loan is high-risk. Next, we created the features (X) DataFrame by dropping the "loan_status" column and keeping the remaining columns. Then, we split the data into training and testing datasets using "train_test_split. Then, we created a logistic regreesion model, calculated the accuracy, generated a confusion matrix and printed the classification report with the data. 

In the next part of the assignment, we used the RandomOverSampler module to create a random oversampler model. Then, we used the resampled data to create a logistic regression model, calculate the accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and print the classification report. 


2. The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

3. A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

Based on the accuracy scores of the model with the original data (97%) and the resampled data (99%), I would recommend the model, since the accuracy score is near-perfect.
